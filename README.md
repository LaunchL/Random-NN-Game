# Random-NN-Game
Play with the Neural Network Perceptron. Made by Lab.
FAQ:
1. How does the game work?
It works as follows: Neural Nework Perceptron calculates the number and if
the value of the number is equal to or greater than 0.8 then you lose. Otherwise, you win.
Well, that's all.
2. Why Python?
Python is handy for creating a Neural Network. That's why.
Change-Log:
1.0.0 A game written by Neural Network was created. And the interface and logic of the game are written. 
Bugs: You need to exit the game to play again ...
